                that not everyone might enjoy but you do. Here are a few of my hobbies below</p>

                <!-- Opening Paragraph -->
                <p> Prior to my housemate moving to Japan, he used to manage and tend to the garden and it all seemed
                    out of my
                    reach. After he left in 2020, nobody was able to tend to the herbs and tomato plants that he raised.
                    I decided it
                    would be terrible to let his hard work go to waste and now I have become quite adept at identifying
                    and propagating
                    different types of herbs and fruit. Presently my favorite fruit to grow is chilli and I have around
                    8 chilli plants as of writing this.
                </p>

                    If you are interested in learning some easy ways to get started in gardening, I have provided some
                    tips on this website which
                    can be accessed by clicking gardening tips option in the navigation bar or by <a

                <!-- Opening Paragraph -->
                <p>Gaming has been a hobby of mine since I was 5 years old and was gifted a gameboy for my birthday.
                    My first game was Game and Watch Gallery, which was a mixture of both Modernized and Classic Game
                    and Watch games. The modern versions featured
                    mario characters such as Yoshi, Mario and Princess Peach.
                </p>

                <!-- Second Paragraph -->
                <p>The first non handheld console was a Sega Megadrive. When we made the leap from the Sega System to
                    the first Playstation
                    I was blown away with the change in graphics from 2d to 3d. Metal Gear Solid has to be my favorite
                    franchise thus far.</p>

            <!-- Opening Paragraph -->
            <p style="padding: 7px 0px 0px 5px"> I love anime. When I first started watching anime I did not know it
                was from Japan at first. I
                thought they were cartoons the
                same way Scooby-Doo was, with a different style. The first anime I ever watched was Dragon Ball Z.
                What got me into lesser main stream anime however
                was when I was watching an anime called Tokyo Mew Mew in English and it abruptly stopped being
                dubbed. I wanted to know the rest so I sought it out online. </p>

            <!-- Second Paragraph -->
            <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 5px">The english dub was very cute and innocent featuring magical girls.
                However when I saw the Japanese
                dub, I
                realized how much was censored and how gory and violent the anime actually was and I was very
                intrigued upon realizing that anime was not just 'cartoons for children'.
                Since then I have gone down a rabbit hole and seen all kinds of anime. I love it. Whenever I go to
                Japan I always bring back figurines for myself and friends.</p>
