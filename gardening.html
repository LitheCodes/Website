			<h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
			<p> Gardening can be complicated or it can be simple. Some plants can require a lot of care, some plants can
				require barely any. The best thing about gardening is that it can be scaled up or down based on so many
				variables.
				While gardening is a hobby of mine <em>now</em>, I used to find the concept daunting. When my housemate
				moved out and could no longer tend the fruit and herbs
				he cultivated, I took over and maintained the garden, learning a lot about plants along the way. I've
				provided some tips to get started on a low maintainence and cheap garden.

				<!-- Opening Paragraph -->
				<p>Spring onions are one of the easiest plants for an aspiring gardener to grow. They are easy
					to
					maintain,
					they grow fast and you don't even need to buy seeds!
					If your grocery store sells spring onions with the roots still attached, buy a bunch and
					follow
					the guide below </p>

				<!-- Guide to grow Spring Onions (List) -->
				<h3>Step-By-Step Guide</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Buy Spring Onions</li>
					<li>Cut the spring onions down to slightly above the base (Where the roots come from)</li>
					<li>Make a small hole in dirt and bury the roots entirely (Fertile dirt is preferred, but
						spring
						onions are very sturdy.</li>
					<li>Water the spring onions</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If you followed the steps above, check your spring onions tomorrow, you should notice growth!
					(Wow, so quick!) </p>

				<h2 class="title">Lamiaceae Herb Cultivation and Cloning</h2>

				<a href="https://www.amazingherbgarden.com/rooting-basil-cuttings/"><img src="images/basil.png" alt=""
						width="200" height="200" class="right"></a>

				<!-- Paragraph -->
				<p>While growing from seed is an option, herbs in the Lamiacaea family can be cultivated, or
					"cloned" from existing plants to create healthy copies of those plants
					that will grow individually. In terms of success rate, this depends on the herb with leafy
					herbs
					like mint and basil being easier
					and woodier herbs such as rosemary being more difficult.

					<!-- List -->
				<h3>Lamiacae Herbs</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Mint</li>
					<li>Basil (and thai basil)</li>
					<li>Rosemary</li>
					<li>Sage</li>
					<li>Oregano</li>
					<li>Lavendar</li>
					<li>and more</li>
				</ul>

				<!-- Step by Step guide to cloning herbs-->
				<h3>Step-By-Step Guide</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Take a cutting from a healthy plant (Ensure you leave as much of the stem on your
						cutting as
						possible)</li>
					<li>Cut off all leaves except for the top most leaves</li>
					<li>Change water once a day while waiting for the herb to grow roots from the stem</li>
					<li>Once roots are grown, bury roots in dirt and ensure plant is watered</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				<p>If you're worried about harming your plant by taking cuttings, be reassured. Cutting lamiacae
					plants actually encourages growth! (wow).
					Cutting a lamiacae herb above the leaf will prompt two new stems to grow diagonally
					from where you cut. You can then try using the cutting you took either in your cooking, or
					to
					make another plant! (amazing). If you are taking cuttings from plants that are not your own,
					make sure to ask permission first!</p>
